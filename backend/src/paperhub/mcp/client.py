"""Per-server MCP connector (SRS v2.5, §III-6.1).

`MCPClient` wraps the official Anthropic `mcp` Python SDK
(`mcp.client.streamable_http.streamablehttp_client` + `mcp.ClientSession`)
behind a small surface tailored to PaperHub's Research Agent dispatch:

* `connect()` is idempotent and uses exponential backoff (cap 4 attempts)
  before raising `MCPUnavailableError` for transport-level failures.
* `list_tools()` returns LiteLLM-shaped JSON-schema tool dicts with the
  upstream tool names namespaced (`<server>.<tool>`), filtered by the
  `expose` allowlist, with `aliases` applied.
* `call_tool(name, args)` accepts either the original upstream name *or*
  its alias (the registry strips the `<server>.` prefix before calling),
  enforces the per-server `timeout_seconds`, distinguishes transport
  failures (`MCPUnavailableError`) from upstream tool errors
  (`MCPToolError`).

Only the `streamable_http` transport is wired in v2.5-1; `stdio` raises
`NotImplementedError`. Plan E wires the stdio path when it adds the
sqlite MCP server block.
