"""End-to-end loopback proof for Task v2.5-7.

This is the test that would have caught the v2.5-6 bug originally:
the agent's production code path is

    chat endpoint
      → set_client_headers_context(session_id=…, run_id=…)
        → LangGraph paper_search subgraph
          → MCPRegistry.call('papers.search_library', …)
            → MCPClient.call_tool
              → streamablehttp_client(url, headers={X-Paperhub-Session-Id: …})
                → HTTP POST /mcp
                  → PaperhubPapersRequestContextMiddleware (reads the header)
                    → FastMCP tool handler
                      → search_library_dispatch
                      → tracer writes a tool_calls row

before v2.5-7, `streamablehttp_client(url)` was called with no headers,
the middleware saw no `X-Paperhub-Session-Id` header, fell through to the
"pass through without a context" branch, and the FastMCP handler then
raised because the contextvar was unset — 500 to the agent, masking the
bug as "transient MCP failure".

The test mounts the FastMCP server on a FastAPI app and instantiates an
`MCPClient` pointing at the in-process loopback `/mcp`. It does NOT spin
up the full chat endpoint — that would pull in LiteLLM + tracing harness
which makes the test fragile. Instead it sets the client_headers
contextvar directly (the same shim the chat endpoint uses) and asserts
the call succeeds + lands in a `tool_calls` row tagged with the same
session_id we set.
